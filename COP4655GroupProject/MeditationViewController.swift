                The strategy here is to first get the number of times we need to play the whole sound by divinding the input seconds by the length of the sound and casting to Int.
 
                Then, we start the sound in the middle using the cutoff to deal with the remainder (particularly noticeable for long input sounds like 1 minute ambient loops you might think about while meditating).
 
                For instance, if we need to play the sound 5.4 times to play it for one minute, then we start it at 0.6 to play the last 0.4, and then play the entire sound 5 times after that.
